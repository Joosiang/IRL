## Technologies Used

    - The project uses **XAMPP** to build site offline on a local host server

- [MySQL](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **MySQL** for database management system and writing queries where ever necessary


- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
    - The project uses **PHP** to be used in different database languages like MySQL


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Login: (Administrator, Student and Lecturer)
    1. Go to the "Index" page.
    2. Try to login without entering any information entered and verify that a relevant error message appears.

2. Install Software on Notebook: (Admin)
    1. Go to the "Manage Notebook" page.
    2. Try to select a laptop and the software to install and the software name should reflect on the notebook.

3. Add a Notebook: (Admin)
    1. Go to the "Manage Notebook" page and click on "Add Notebook".
    2. Type the information accordingly and it should appear in the "Manage Notebook" page.

4. Delete a Notebook: (Admin)
    1. Go to the "Manage Notebook" page and click on "Delete" on any of the notebook.
    2. The notebook details should be deleted.

5. Add a project: (Admin)
    1. Go to "Manage Project" page and click on "Add Project".
    2. Type the information accordingly and it should appear in the "Manage Projects" page.

6. Delete a project: (Admin)
    1. Go to the "Manage Notebook" page and click on "Delete" on any of the notebook.
    2. The project details should be deleted.
